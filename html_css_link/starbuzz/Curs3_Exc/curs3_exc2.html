    <h2>Wait, what?</h2>
    <p>Wait a minute, i said i wanted simple,but not boring.What is up with this
    design? There is nothing but white space and some text and a minimal picture.
    Thats not what i had in mind.The type is all in Helvetica, which i like, but it doesn't
    excite me at all.There is just no character to anything here.It has a minimal look, but
    it's just to vanilla. I really need something to grab attention of a visitor to the site and
    this just doesn't do it.
